### Hi!
I'm a plant evolutionary biologist by training and a data scientist by trade. The bulk of the Baker Lab's original data collection wound down in December of 2021. However, I still work on analyzing data, writing and reviewing manuscripts, an Associate Editor for [Applications in Plant Sciences](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/21680450), and serve on several committees with the [Botanical Society of America](https://botany.org/). 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on field-based hyperspectral phenotyping, QTL mapping, network modeling &  phenotypic integration, stomatal density & gas exchange, leaf morphometrics, and flooding-induced root aerenchyma formation.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on plant science projects inlcuding quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental morphology, and phenotyping. I'm excited to contribute statistical analyses, data visualization, manuscript preparation, or custom data science needs such as R package or Shiny App development.
-  I'm also available and have experience teaching workshops on R, data management, and version control for a wide variety of participants in person  and virtually.

If you're interested in my work at the [National Park Service](https://github.com/nationalparkservice) on creating workflows and tools for authoring metadata and OPEN, FAIR data publication (ðŸ–¥ðŸ“ˆ), please see my [other GitHub account](https://github.com/RobLBaker).
